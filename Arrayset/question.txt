Given a set of elements s = [e1,e2,e3...en], and a number n. Write a program to find whether the addition of two elements in the given set would be equal to the n.

Example: 

S = [3,4,2,5] and n = 8
                        3 + 5 = 8   Possible                   

S = [3,4,2,4] and n = 9
                        Not Possible

Input : 3 4 2 4
         6
